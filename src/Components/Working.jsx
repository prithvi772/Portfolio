        -I applied to 20+ jobs before landing my first $50 gig. I made sure to
        personalize every proposal and added a quick 1-minute Loom video
        introducing myself. The client loved the effort and gave me a 5-star
        review. That one job helped me land more clients and slowly raise my
        rates.

        -I started with blog writing at $10/article, but I always overdelivered
        and asked for honest feedback. Within 3 months, I got a regular client
        in the health niche paying $0.05/word. Now I only apply to jobs that
        match my style and pay range.
