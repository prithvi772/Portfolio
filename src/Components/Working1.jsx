        -I started getting orders on Fiverr after optimizing my gig title and
        adding clear samples to showcase my work. At first, some buyers tried to
        demand premium work for basic prices, so I updated my gig description
        and FAQs to set clear boundaries.

        -My task was to write SEO-friendly product descriptions for Adidas
        running shoes. The brief was detailed, and they provided training on
        tone and voice. It was a fast-paced job, but rewarding. I now mention
        'Adidas product copywriting' in my proposals and get more fashion
        clients.
