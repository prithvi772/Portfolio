        -I began my journey on Freelancer by bidding on small projects with
        personalized proposals and competitive pricing. Initially, it was hard
        to stand out, but once I completed a few jobs with 5-star reviews, my
        profile started gaining traction. Clear communication, meeting
        deadlines.

        -Starting on Freelancer was tough—I had to bid on dozens of projects
        before landing my first one. I focused on writing detailed proposals
        that addressed the client’s needs directly, which finally got me
        noticed.
